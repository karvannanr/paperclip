# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-13)

**Core value:** Agents running on Ollama should have the same first-class experience as Claude agents — same tools, same memory injection, same real-time feedback.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Ollama Tools + Memory Injection

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Ollama Tools + Memory Injection)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-04-13 — Roadmap created (6 phases, 12 requirements mapped)

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Architecture: Inject memories at heartbeat level (server-side), not per-adapter — centralized approach
- Streaming: Use Ollama `stream: true` via SSE to existing run output endpoint (reuse existing real-time infra)
- Company memories: Separate DB table (not nullable agentId) — cleaner schema semantics
- [Phase 01-ollama-tools-memory-injection]: MEMORY-01 (agentMemoriesForInjection in execute.ts) was already implemented — no changes to execute.ts required
- [Phase 01-ollama-tools-memory-injection]: paperclip_update_goal uses partial PATCH pattern — only args fields present in call are sent in updates body
- [Phase 02-ollama-streaming]: Path A final response uses stream:true sub-request (no tools param); tool-calling iterations stay stream:false
- [Phase 02-ollama-streaming]: Partial output durability relies on onLog side-effect persistence; no explicit flush needed in execute.ts
- [Phase 03-company-shared-memories]: ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING (not DO UPDATE) for company memories save — no updated_at bump; simpler than agentMemoryService approach
- [Phase 03-company-shared-memories]: MemoryContentTooLargeError re-exported from agent-memories.ts to prevent duplicate error classes breaking instanceof checks
- [Phase 03-company-shared-memories]: Tags lowercased in company service (stricter normalization for company-wide shared scope)
- [Phase 03-company-shared-memories]: paperclip_list_company_memories limit clamped 1-200, default 50
- [Phase 03-company-shared-memories]: Manual query-param validation used instead of zod schema for company memory GET route
- [Phase 03-company-shared-memories]: POST /api/companies/:companyId/memories returns 201 with memory object directly (no deduped wrapper)
- [Phase 04-goals-budget-ui]: GoalProgressBar extracted as named export, returns null for totalIssues===0 and undefined/null progress (unified empty state)
- [Phase 05-agent-template-propose-bulk]: Appended Stapler Tools section to default AGENTS.md — preamble unchanged, H3 code-span format for each tool
- [Phase 05-agent-template-propose-bulk]: Guard !agent added to handleBulkCreate to satisfy TypeScript (agent is possibly undefined in component scope)
- [Phase 06-ollama-benchmarking]: Sequential benchmark loop (not parallel) to avoid overloading Ollama
- [Phase 06-ollama-benchmarking]: Link placed in AdapterManager header alongside Install Adapter button as a utility link

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3 (Company Shared Memories) requires a new Drizzle migration — confirm migration tooling works before starting
- Phase 6 (Benchmarking) depends on Ollama `/api/tags` listing installed models — verify endpoint availability
