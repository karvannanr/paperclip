/**
 * Continuous run scoring — Pillar 1 of the Quality Flywheel.
 *
 * Every successful heartbeat run (when `autoScoreRuns: true` is set in the
 * agent's adapterConfig) is judged by the LLM judge against a generic
 * quality rubric and the score is persisted in `run_scores`.
 *
 * Rubric source priority (future pillars will extend this):
 *   1. Issue acceptance criteria (if the run is tied to an issue)
 *   2. Goal acceptance criteria (if the run is tied to a goal)
 *   3. Generic quality rubric (fallback)
 *
 * Today only (3) is wired; (1) and (2) are stubbed for later pillars.
 *
 * Fire-and-forget from the heartbeat finalize path — callers use
 * `void maybeScoreRun(...).catch(...)` so judge failures never crash runs.
